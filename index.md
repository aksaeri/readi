## Why we exist

1. We are part of [a community](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) that uses reason and evidence to identify how to do the most good with what we have
2. Realising the promise of "doing the most good with what we have" requires better decision-making and behaviour change
3. Improved decision-making and behaviour change feature prominently as part of Effective Altruism community activities implicit or explicit theories of change, but the science of decision-making and behaviour is often missing
4. Academic and applied researchers in decision-making and behaviour science could have greatly increased impact if they directed their research activities towards the most pressing problems
5. READI has the expertise and the networks to increase the use of behaviour science in service of doing the most good
