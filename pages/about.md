# About READI

READI coordinates and conducts behaviour science research to improve decision-making and behaviour for the world's most pressing problems.

Michael Noetel, Alexander Saeri and Peter Slattery are academic researchers who met at EAGx Sydney in 2017 and founded EAARC in 2019. Emily Grundy joined READI to lead the animal products review in 2019 and became part of the READI leadership team in 2020.

Members of the Initiative include advisors, subject matter experts for each research project; team leaders, for experienced researchers who lead or manage our research projects; and members, for students and junior researchers who want to learn research skills and contribute to project execution.

## What we do

As a research collaboration, we

1. identify research areas where behaviour change or improved decision-making would do the most good
2. coordinate and conduct rigorous applied research to discover how to change behaviour or improve decision-making, and
3. amplify the reach and impact of behavioural evidence so that it can help support doing the most good with what we have.

### Identifying where behaviour change or improved decision-making is needed to do the most good

We use research-informed co-design and prioritisation processes to identify projects where behaviour change is needed to do the most good

This includes connecting practitioners in an area (e.g., animal welfare charity) with expert researchers (e.g., public health dietitians, moral psychologists) and interested volunteers (e.g., EA community members) to select impactful, relatively neglected, and highly tractable research questions and projects

### Coordinating and conducting rigorous applied research

We have extensive academic and EA networks, and can act as a coordinating group for research projects owned by others

We have specific expertise in conducting primary (e.g., experimental, survey) and secondary (e.g., meta-analysis, systematic literature review) research
In each case, our experience in academic and applied research means we can create knowledge that is immediately useful and rigorous enough to contribute to academic knowledge

### Amplifying the reach and impact of behavioural evidence

We increase the reach of behavioural evidence by using academic and non-academic dissemination activities, including publishing in scholarly journals, creating accessible summaries of our and others' research relevant to doing the most good.

We increase the impact of behavioural evidence by creating tools for applying the results of our and others' research into practice, building the capacity of user groups to implement evidence-based recommendations, and iteratively calibrating our research processes to ensure that they are delivering counterfactual value for research users.

## How you can get involved

As an **Effective Altruism community member**, you can volunteer your time to learn about and conduct rigorous applied research as part of our systematic review and meta-analysis teams.

As a **researcher or practitioner** working in the areas of international development, global poverty, existential and/or catastrophic risks, artificial intelligence governance, animal welfare, the long-term future, climate change, decision-making, behaviour science, you can (1) volunteer your time as a project advisory team member to increase the quality and usefulness of research we conduct in these areas, or (2) contact us to discuss how we can collaborate on research.

As a **research commissioner or funder** who wants to improve individual and collective decision-making and behaviour change on the world's most pressing problems, you can contribute financially to help support READI's activities.
