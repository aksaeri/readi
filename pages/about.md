# About READI

The Rapid Effective Action Development Initiative (READI) is a group of volunteers who conduct research and provide evidence-informed, rigorous and implementable recommendations for practitioners working on signficant societal problems.

Michael Noetel, Alexander Saeri and Peter Slattery are academic researchers who met at EAGx Sydney in 2017 and founded EAARC in 2019. 

Members of the Initiative include advisors, subject matter experts for each research project; team leaders, for experienced researchers who lead or manage our research projects; and members, for students and junior researchers who want to learn research skills and contribute to project execution.
