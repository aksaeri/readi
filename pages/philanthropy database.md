# Philanthopy research database

In collaboration with Giving What We Can and Innovations in Fundraising READI have curated a database of more than 1,000 research articles on how to promote philanthropy and donating. 

The aim is to help people working on charity research and practice to access and manage relevant research and stay up to date with the relevant research.

There are two ways to access this database. You can download this RIS file (via Google Drive), and open it with a free citation library manager (e.g. Zotero). Alternatively, you can download this CSV/spreadsheet.

We curate updates about the newest articles added to the database each quarter and post these on social media (follow Peter on Linkedin). We will create a dedicated account or newsletter if there is demand.

At this stage, the database is a prototype that we are looking to validate. We will add more research and improvements if we are convinced that it is useful. If you would like to offer feedback then please complete this feedback form to support or offer feedback.

If you have questions then please read the FAQ below. If you have questions that haven't been addressed or a comment, then please submit it here.

# FAQ

## Why might this database be useful to my charity or fundraising organisation?
 
* Engage with academic research like a researcher. As researchers know, search engines and citation management systems are the best way to engage with academic research.  We can do the searching part for you and can make the second part really easy (see below).
 
* Know the latest research - sure academic research isn’t always very actionable or intpretable, but there are often significant and clear findings like the identifiable victim effect. It is important to know about and react to these insights as quickly as possible. 
 
* Know the relevant researchers - keep on top of who is producing most of the research relevant to your areas of fundraising
 
* Simplify research and strategy development. Use the database (alongside zotero) to give you easier and quicker answers about key questions such as how, what and when to message potential donors and what to show on your website and promotional materials.
 
* Use tagging to curate key sets of papers inside your reference management system to answer very specific questions. 
 
* Save time finding the information you need. No more searching on google scholar and trying to filter through thousands of irrelevant responses. Let us do more of the searching and filtering for you.
 
## Can you show me how to download, access and use the database?
Yes we can. Here is a short video showing you how you can have this up and running on zotero in less than five minutes.

## What is the long term plan for this if it is useful?
In the long term this work could support a ‘living review’ (i.e. a literature review that is kept up-to-date (potentially like this).

These and other material would be hosted within a 'philanthropy research toolkit', like this.

## How should I interpret the findings from individual papers?
Don’t necessarily trust and apply any single finding in isolation. These studies discuss, theorizing, measuring, and testing a range of concepts, but they don't offer "direct pointers on what to do". Unfortunately there are no simple answers to how best to run your charity. However, considering research makes it more likely that you will make better decisions.

## How can I help or join the collaboration?
Please email peter.slattery@monash.edu if you are interested in joining the collaboration or would like to help with maintaining the database. Volunteers will need some basic experience with collecting and managing research articles. 

If you are a philanthropy researcher, we would appreciate it if you can contribute some of your research from any personal database you maintain. You can usually export some, or all records as an RIS file from most software (XML is also fine).
