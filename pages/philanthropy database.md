In collaboration with Giving What We Can and Innovations in Fundraising READI have curated a database of more than 1,000 research articles on how to promote philanthropy and donating. 

The aim is to help people working on charity research and practice to access and manage relevant research and stay up to date with the relevant research.

There are two ways to access this database. You can download this RIS file (via Google Drive), and open it with a free citation library manager (e.g. Zotero). Alternatively, you can download this CSV/spreadsheet.

We curate updates about the newest articles added to the database each quarter and post these on social media (follow Peter on Linkedin). We will create a dedicated account or newsletter if there is demand.

At this stage, the database is a prototype that we are looking to validate. We will add more research and improvements if we are convinced that it is useful. If you would like to offer feedback then please complete this feedback form to support or offer feedback.

If you have questions then please read the FAQ below. If you have questions that haven't been addressed or a comment, then please submit it here.
