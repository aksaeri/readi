# Research projects

## What are people's experiences and behaviours in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?

The Survey of COVID-19 Responses to Understand Behaviour (SCRUB) project aims to provide current and future policy makers with actionable insights into public attitudes and behaviours relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Building on the COSMO project, a WHO/Europe initiative - we are running a “living survey” -- with both repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal sampling --  throughout the pandemic. In this survey we track relevant protective behaviours (e.g., handwashing and social distancing) their variations by demographic and location, and their determinants. We also test interventions.

After each wave of data collection, we generate and disseminate an updated report. 

We have over 100 international collaborators and more than 4000 people across 40 countries have completed the first and second waves of data collection.
