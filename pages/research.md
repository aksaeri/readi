# Research projects

## What are people's experiences and behaviours in response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?

The SCRUB project aimed to provide current and future policy makers with actionable insights into public attitudes and behaviours relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Building on the COSMO project, a WHO/Europe initiative - we ran a “living survey” – with both repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal sampling – throughout the pandemic. In this survey we tracked relevant protective behaviours (e.g., handwashing and social distancing) their variations by demographic and location, and their determinants. We also tested interventions.

SCRUB ran every 3-4 weeks since March 2020 until June 2021. We measured:

- what people are doing to keep themselves safe (e.g., distancing, mask-wearing, willingness to vaccinate, compliance with rules) and why;
- the impact of COVID-19 on lives and livelihoods (e.g., mental health and wellbeing, work arrangements, government payments and community services, worries);
- beliefs and expectations of a sustainable recovery (e.g., household finances, travel, COVIDSafe workplaces)
- changes in related attitudes related issues such as meat consumption and pandemic preparedness

After each wave of data collection, we generated and disseminated a report for relevant policy makers.

More than 50,000 surveys in more than 40 countries were completed. The vast majority of this was Australian data, but we also collected over 3000 international responses.
